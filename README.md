# currency-calc
Currency calculator written in Python.
This is a learning exercise for me.

CLI function is chortled in both  py3.
py2 can read input string and multiply as long as input
 includes ' '

py3 outputs rate.get() as a str I can't convert to float,
find library, or fancy way to convert.



Interface.py has a similar issue
