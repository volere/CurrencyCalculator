# currency-calc
Currency calculator written in Python.
This is a learning exercise for me.
Very messy, works with python 2.7

Starting point.  Concuren.py pulls from exchangeratesapi.io  
Grabanread.py uses local file usethis.json.  
Grabanread.py works on the command line if you type the country code with ' ', ie. 'USD'

Next steps are to improve the CLI version

Interface.py is a starting point for GUI
